# Air-Bnb-Full-project-in-Tableau
This Tableau project focuses on Airbnb listings, providing insights into nearby accommodations in the area of Settle. The analysis begins with a comparison of house prices based on zip codes, shedding light on the variations in pricing across different areas. Visual representation on a map enhances the understanding of these differences. Furthermore, the project delves into revenue trends over time by correlating it with weekly dates, presenting a clear line graph. Finally, the project examines the relationship between the number of bedrooms and the average price, elucidating the impact of bedroom count on pricing. Inspired by Alex The Analyst's teachings on YouTube, this project aims to offer a comprehensive understanding of Airbnb housing dynamics in the Settle region.
